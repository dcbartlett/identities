### a Node.Js game Built on Sails

## Vision & Goals
Create a cross platform multiplayer RPG wich is easy to learn but hard to master with a procedurally generated content.

The RPG has the same movement style has the Pokemon games. Art style follows the [LPC](http://lpc.opengameart.org/) style guide. Their is a class system simillar to RuneScape.

The game is accessible to people. We assure this by using a HTML5 and Canvases for the frontend, this is to assure cross platform compatibility. We use Node.js in the backend to continue using the same language that we have in the front as well as being able to assure easy modding of the game.
